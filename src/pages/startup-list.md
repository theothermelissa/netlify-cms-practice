1. who are the users?

  -M:  end-use consumers wanting comparison data on multiple lenders and their programs and terms
  
  -C: users who know the loan(s) they need, but don't know the banks that offer them

2. What is the essence of their dissatisfaction? If they read this answer, would they say “thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way”? 

  -C: Lenders loan terms aren't searchable, sortale, and filterable

  -M: It's easy to compare rates, but finding and comparing *terms* across multiple lenders is difficult, time-consuming, and unpleasant.

3. What are you building for them?

  -C: Building a database of lenders and their terms with data visualizations and content built on top of it. The content built atop the database is created to truly answer their query.

  -M: A place to find lenders who offer the specialty loans they need at the terms that best meet their goals.

4. Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer explaining the product and how it eliminates their dissatisfaction. 

  -M: "FINALLY found a lender for the camper/boat/trailer! Fulltiming/livingaboard/homeownership, here we come!"

  -C: 

5. Write a blog post title for your product launch. Is it surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the next day? 

  -M: "Every Lender, Every Loan, Right Here"

  -C:

6. Write the first paragraph of your product announcement blog post. Include the product name, an explanation of what the product is, the target market, the main benefit, and the call to action.

7. What “metrics of goodness” do your target customers care about? Does your product dominate every available alternative on these metrics? 

# Growth

8. Fill in the bottom-up market size equation: NUM_USERS * ACV = MARKET_SIZE. Are your numbers credible? Find a good reference class if you’re building something completely new. 

9. Which subset of your target customers are so constrained by the status quo, they’ll welcome a buggy product? 
<= 140 chars

  M: My guess is probably most of them. Sailboatlistings.com is a great example of this -- it's not a great site, or even a good one, but it *lets you see everything* that you're looking for. So it's consistently among the top of the SERP. 

10. List your first ten customers. 
<= 240 chars 

  M: Two boat buyers, an rv buyer, four mobile home buyers, a house flipper, an overachieving first-time homebuyer, a motorcycle buyer, and a student loan refinancer.

11. Which playbook will you use to get customers after the first ten? 
<= 240 chars 

  M: Three things: 
  - press releases
  - fb ads
  - social engagement -- reddit, quora, etc.

12. What would need to be true in 18 months for you to get essentially unlimited cheap capital? How will you achieve that? 
<= 240 chars

  M: We need hundreds to thousands of visitors per month in each major metro area, and we need to collect, analyze, and -- most importantly -- package their visiting data in a way that answers *banks'* pressing questions regarding market demand and competitors' products. 

# Strategy

13. Why now? What’s true about the world that nobody else figured out yet? 
<= 240 chars

14. What is the most ambitious achievable milestone for your company within a 25 year time horizon? 
<= 70 chars

15. Is your product a credible advance toward this milestone? 
Yes/no

16. What’s the next credible advance toward this milestone? The one after that? The one after that? 
<= 240 chars 

17. How will you build a moat? 
<= 240 chars 

18. What would reaching your 25 year milestone mean for the world? Is this future really exciting? How many years of your life would you give up to teleport there? If you found yourself in this counterfactual world, would you want to go back? 
<= 140 chars

19. If another company was working on this idea and not you, what would you think about it? Would you join them? 
Yes/no

20. Imagine yourself standing in front of your team, investors, family, and friends. You’ve failed, and they’re waiting for you to speak. What will you say? Are you willing to work on this problem given that failure is the default? 
<= 480 chars 

21. What’s your company’s stock ticker symbol? 
@sama: “it’s easy/fun to say every new startup you hear about is bad. you will usually be right. you will never be successful.”

22. Is it likely to be the most important company started this year?
